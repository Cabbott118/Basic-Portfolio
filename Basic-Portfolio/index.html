            I grew up in a small town in Central Florida. The kind of small
            town where you couldn't go anywhere and not run into somebody you knew.
            I have fond memories of going to the grocery store with my father, and
            every time being introduced to someone he knew - somehow. I thought he
            was the most popular man on the planet. My father, and both of my
            grandfathers had work ethics like you would not believe. They were some
            of the most intelligent men I would ever have the pleasure of knowing.
            These men were my biggest role models. From the time I could hold myself
            upright in a seat, one of my grandfathers, who I had nicknamed
            "Papa Orange," had me in the passenger seat of his Cessna 172. This man
            and his plane are the reasons I chose to pursue the career path I had
            originally set out on.
            <br><br>
            At an early age, I had developed an addiction,
            or "sickness" as my grandfather referred to it as, to looking upward to
            the sky when I heard the roaring of an overhead engine. Flying with him in
            his Cessna was my release. It was what I'd
            default to, whether I was not having a great day, or just wanted to have
            fun. There was something about the feeling of it that I found exhilarating.
            For the longest time, I knew... as long as I could just be around planes
            I would be happy with whatever career path I was to take. My cousin graduated
            from Parris Island in 2007 and told me of this program he would be starting soon
            that would allow him to eventually become an officer in the United States Marine
            Corp and begin flight school. The thought of this made the hair on my arms stand
            at attention. I told myself, "This doesn't have to be a dream anymore."
            <br><br>
            Fastforward a few years - I am graduating high school and am prospecting potential
            colleges. One university in particular caught my eye largely in part to a program
            they had with another university. I would attend 3 years, majoring in either Math or
            Physics and then transfer to the second university where I could finish that degree
            and also only have a few more courses to take to obtain an Engineering degree,
            all while working towards my end goal: flying jets.
            <br><br>
            During my time at the first university, I was playing football and had made
            some incredible friends. One of which was a Computer Science major. He told me I
            should check out a couple of programming courses, since they of course, would
            count for electives in my program. I gave it a shot and was genuinely enjoying
            myself. I have always loved solving puzzles and learning new things and this
            captured both of those things and combined them.
